Gin is a spirit defined by its juniper character. While many gins contain other botanicals, juniper must be the predominant flavor for a spirit to be called gin.

Common styles:
- London Dry Gin
- Plymouth Gin
- Old Tom Gin
- New Western Gin

My favorite bottles:
1. Hendrick's - for its cucumber and rose notes
2. The Botanist - for its complex herbal profile
3. Monkey 47 - for special occasions
