A well-stocked home bar doesn't mean having everything - it means having the right things.

Essential tips:
1. Start with one spirit category you love
2. Buy quality mixing glasses and shakers
3. Always have fresh citrus
4. Store vermouth in the fridge
5. Date your opened bottles

Remember: A home bar is built over time. Focus on quality over quantity, and learn to make a few drinks really well before expanding your collection.
