Everyone's talking about [ai-2027.com](http://ai-2027.com/), **but I want to talk about Thomas Kuhn** (be careful: I've finally found the courage to write about philosophy here)

For those who missed this week's hot topic in AI news — check out [ai-2027.com](http://ai-2027.com/), a speculative timeline put together by a few top-tier AI folks. They sketch a path from 2025 to 2027, forecasting increasingly advanced AI agents, massive compute investments, and an AI arms race between the U.S. and China. The usual fun stuff.

But while everyone shouts "Revolution!", I kept wondering: **What would Thomas Kuhn say?**

Kuhn studied scientific revolutions. Not just big discoveries — but the deeper _paradigm shifts_ that change how we even think about knowledge. So here's a take on the AI landscape through his lens:

### 📚 Pre-Science – Symbolic AI (1940s–1980s)

_[By Kuhn: period with no unified framework]_

- Early thinkers like Turing and McCarthy toyed with symbolic systems and primitive neural networks.
- There is no shared methodology or dominant approach — just scattered ideas and big questions.

### 🔬 Normal Science – Classical ML (1980s–2000s)

_[By Kuhn: establishment of a dominant paradigm]_

- Statistical learning takes over.

- Our beloved: SVM, decision trees, Bayesian models.
- Everyone's focused on improving the same core idea: new algorithms, better architecture, more data.

### 🌀 Model Drift – Deep Learning Emerges (2000s–2010s)

_[By Kuhn: more and more anomalies that challenges the existing paradigm]_

- Classical ML struggles with unstructured data like images or natural language.
- The time has come for deep learning.
- Neural networks start outperforming everything — but they come with new problems: they're not transparent, really heavy, and still make weird mistakes.

### ⚠️ Model Crisis (Late 2010s–2023)

_[By Kuhn: losing confidence in the existing paradigm]_

The challenges pile up:

- Not much of explainability
- Huge energy costs
- Fragility outside training data
- Still inaccessible to most businesses, beside tech-heavy use cases

### 🚀 Revolution – Generative AI (2023–Today)

_[By Kuhn: the emergence of a new paradigm, better addresses the problems and anomalies]_

- GenAI is here! Suddenly we're talking about creativity, understanding, even ethics and regulations.
- CEOs are threatening to replace employees who don't prompt fast enough.
- The cultural moment is huge, with the promise of changing the way we work.

### But, will this revolutionary technology bring us a paradigm shift?

According to Kuhn, a true scientific revolution doesn't just excite researchers and tech early adopters — it rewires how we build roads, adopt hobbies and write laws. For those areas, I feel changing the paradigm is still far away - try speaking with a general contractor or a physician about their problems. Maybe 2027 is quite optimistic.

**Society tends to move slower than excited engineers in Migdalei Alon**. The real work will be to bring it to the actual world. _Let's begin_.

**Next time**: What would Kant think about MCP?
