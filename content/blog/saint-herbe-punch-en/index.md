To this day, my favorite bar was Franz57. On Brenner Street opposite the market, with happy hour until 21:00 and about 14 seats. There was always a spot, so I kept it in absolute secrecy. Maybe that's also what led to its closure at the end of 2017, and since then I tell publicly about places I love.

When it closed, in a move that today I understand how special it was, the owners published their complete recipe collection online. I had no knowledge, equipment, bottles or even my own apartment, but I downloaded the recipes and kept them - for the day when I would have them and be worthy of them.

This was my regular cocktail. Sour, special, strong. After I bought my first shaker, I went to my parents because obviously I didn't have all the esoteric spices to make the syrup. My dad excitedly went out with me to the garden to light the fire and roast the spices. We both enjoyed it so much that he later bought me a burner so I could have one. No longer need the alley opposite the market.

### For the cocktail
- 60 ml gin (preferably Plymouth)
- 30 ml lime juice
- 20 ml herbe syrup
- 2 pieces of pineapple

Muddle the pineapple in the shaker, then add all ingredients and shake. Strain into an old-fashioned glass with ice.
Garnish with grapefruit, lemon zest and a large basil head.

### The syrup
Put 20 ml Pernod in a small pot with coriander seeds, fennel seeds, some dried sage, chopped lemongrass branch, kaffir lime, lime peel, star anise. Light it and let the spices roast. Don't be afraid!

When you get tired or the fire starts to die down, add 100g sugar and 80 ml water, and stir until the fire dies completely. Add fresh mint, boil and turn off. Strain, transfer to a clean container and store in the refrigerator.

> #### Final notes
> If the syrup is too much, you can make regular syrup and use Opihr gin. Its spices are strong and very similar.
>
> You can also replace the Pernod (which is sweetened) with pastis or ouzo. I've never tried it with arak, which might take over a bit.
>
> Sugar syrup in general can also last half a year in the refrigerator - here because of the ingredients we infused, it's better to assume it will be about 3 months. In any case, you can open and smell. If it's not good, you'll know.
