## Best Restaurants of the Trip (By City)

### **Lisbon and Surroundings**

* **[Ofício](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yQ3qY322o5yT4G9e9)** (Lisbon): One of the best restaurants on the trip. Modern, interesting, and amazing Portuguese food, with excellent desserts (especially their coffee dish).
* **[Red Frog](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Kk28gqG99x7eS5hJ9)** (Lisbon): A particularly secretive cocktail bar, located inside another bar. A fun experience with excellent cocktails.
* **[O Velho Eurico](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X2z28S9W5Q44w4B58)** (Lisbon): A local restaurant with very tasty food. *Note: Service there is less than stellar*.
* **[Incomum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/351zU8wX2K1JgR536)** (Sintra): Excellent and affordable lunch menu. They also have an attached café.
* **[TimeOut Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/29hQ4b1P1eMhY8Hn7)** (Lisbon): A touristy place, but rightfully so! Very worthwhile, with interesting and delicious food. Keep in mind: it's hard to find seating during peak hours.

### **Porto and the North (Douro Valley)**

* **[Castas e Pratos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6p54rJ27h8Yp5S3A7)** (Peso da Régua): One of the trip's favorites. An amazing restaurant with excellent service, an incredible wine selection, and outstanding simple food (highly recommend: Angus steak and special desserts).
* **[Cantinho do Avillez](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W5z9hR9pLgX2Yd2F9)** (Porto): Excellent place. Affordable and recommended lunch menu - the Thai chicken dish was one of the winning dishes of the entire trip.
* **[Tapabento](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DkYwR4h5W5C5r2Bf6)** (Porto): An amazing Spanish-Portuguese tapas restaurant. Simple food, excellently executed (it was so delicious we ordered more during the meal!).
* **[Mito](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L3gR3yS44kQzT65J6)** (Porto): Super sweet place with excellent modern food, including outstanding desserts.

### **Additional Recommendations**

* **[Gruta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zYwF7N75zG3k5J8H8)** (Porto): Charming restaurant combining Portuguese and Brazilian cuisine. Excellent food and interesting flavors (the beet risotto was excellent).
* **[Solar do Bacalhau](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q7tY5J3qE4uM6gNHA)** (Coimbra): A local fish institution. Overall okay, but not a warm recommendation if you're not a fan of the local bacalhau fish.

## Sweet Treats and Snacks

* **Pastel de Nata Competition Winners:**
    1.  **[Manteigaria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hGz7S9pMhKk3J2xT7)** (the famous chain): Always excellent, won first place for most of us thanks to the crispy puff pastry and lightness.
    2.  **A tiny bakery in Óbidos:** A bubbly pastel stall on the stairs, right next to the pizza place "[A Janela](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3X5K7J4yK7F5w5E7A)", which ranked first for some of us.
* **[Gelateria Portuense](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1V2y9gT4jE5zX6F8B)** (Porto): Excellent gelateria with great ice cream and super special flavors.
* **[A Janela](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3X5K7J4yK7F5w5E7A)** (Óbidos): A small window producing excellent pizzas. Right next to it is a café called **[Avocado](https://maps.app.goo.gl/A2v8X4k5L7W9gC4D9)** with excellent salads - recommended to combine pizza and salad.

## Wine Experience: Winery Tour

* **[Quinta de Pacheca](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E3fS9M7kP8H3dY2C8)**: A winery tour that cost 15 euros per person. The tour was interesting, and the wine was excellent (we especially enjoyed the ports, white, and vintage).

## Tips for Making Reservations (Mandatory!)

At first, we thought the recommendation to reserve at all restaurants was exaggerated, but we learned the hard way: **it's mandatory**! More than once we saw a winding line of desperate people while we walked in thanks to our reservation. Excellent places are in high demand and always busy.

**How to make reservations?**
* **TheFork:** A website and app that provide good service, including average prices and reviews.
* **Restaurant websites/Google/email:** For some places you'll book through their website, Google, or even by email. It's recommended to write the restaurant name in Google with the word "reservation".
* **Alternative solution:** The Portuguese love standing in lines for great places. If you haven't reserved - arriving right at opening might work reasonably well (make sure they accept walk-ins).
