This is the first cocktail I made that people really loved. Sour, tasty. Works excellently in large pitchers, and was my go-to for most of my early mixology years. The story behind it is also heartwarming -
[a capitalist union of forces between 3 brands](https://www.haaretz.co.il/food/cocktails/2024-07-25/ty-article-magazine/.premium/00000190-ba5b-de8b-adfc-bb7b98940000/)

For a long time the person who became my husband said this was his favorite cocktail, which of course annoyed me greatly because there's no technique here, no esoteric raw material, not even an interesting syrup. I would say that today I'm already mature and understand the sophistication in simplicity, but no. Still annoying.

### The cocktail
- 60 ml vodka
- 30 ml lime
- 120 ml ginger beer
Build in a glass with lots and lots of ice.

**Possible upgrades**: mint, lemongrass, kaffir lime, cucumbers.

#### Final notes
For one party, in a moment of courage I tried to make ginger beer myself. It included making ginger syrup and adding soda. I might have skipped the yeast part or things like that because I didn't have any. In retrospect I obviously understand why ginger **beer** isn't created. The cocktail, as expected, was disgusting.
