## Cocktail Bars in Tokyo and Kyoto

This list lacks recent updates - my last visit to Tokyo was in 2020, just before the pandemic.

### Bars in Tokyo

**Bar Benfiddich** - Hidden in an office building in Shinjuku

**High Five** - A basement bar in Ginza

**Bar Trench** - Old-school style

**SG Club** - A multi-level venue

### Bars in Kyoto

**Bee's Knees** - Located by the riverside

**Nokishita 711** - Molecular cocktails

**Pizzeria Bar Le Napoli** - A bonus recommendation for non-cocktail dining

### Golden Gai

A Japanese street filled with tiny bars - a great place to explore.
