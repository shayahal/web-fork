## Colombia Trip: Salento

### Part Seven: The Real Anekto

Salento is a charming tourist town surrounded by lush greenery and nature. I stayed at "Boutique Coffee Tree" and participated in daily group excursions around town.

### Main Activities

**Tejo Game** - A Colombian drinking game involving throwing balls to explode small triangles with gunpowder.

**Cocora Valley** - Described as the main attraction: absolutely stunning. Highly recommended to complete the full trail.

**Coffee Farm Tour** - Finca el Ocaso tour ($100) where we picked coffee, learned about production, and tasted samples. A small shop is available at the town plaza.

**Mirador de Salento** - A scenic viewpoint with ice cream options.

**Town Exploration** - A charming town with small design boutiques.
