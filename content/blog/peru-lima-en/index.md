## Lima: Culinary Paradise

### Peru Trip: Part 1

I chose Lima for 2-3 days despite warnings that "there's nothing to do there." But I was wrong - there's actually a lot!

I stayed at Hotel Antigua in Miraflores and explored both Miraflores and Barranco, the younger, more vibrant neighborhood.

### Museums

**Larco Museum** - A pre-Columbian art collection with guided tours (10 soles)

**Huaca Pucllana** - An ancient pyramid (200-700 CE) made from mud bricks, a unique architectural structure in the world's driest cities

### Restaurant Recommendations

**Fine Dining:**
- **Mérito** - "The winning restaurant of the trip," blending Peruvian and Venezuelan cuisine, recently entered World's 50 Best list
- **Clon** - Sister restaurant with excellent scallops in cocoa sauce
- **Cosme** - Bar-restaurant with exceptional food

**Cevicheries:**
- Punta Azul, El Toke Pez, Barra Maretzo

**Cafés:**
- Ciclos Café, Kaldis

**Cocktail Bars:**
- Lady Bee, Carnaval (with artistic presentation)

Despite thinking Lima had "nothing to do," it turned out to be a culinary paradise with focused-thought restaurants and interesting museums. A must-visit!
