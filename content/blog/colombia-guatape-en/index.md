## Colombia Trip: Guatapé

Guatapé is located about an hour from Medellín. The main attraction there is a beautiful lake with small islands and scenic inlets.

### The Giant Rock

There's a massive boulder that visitors climb via winding stairs to reach a viewpoint. The rock doesn't belong there geologically, so Colombians consider it sacred.

### Recommendations

**Arrive early morning** when the site opens to avoid the crowds of tour buses.

**Stay overnight in the town** - an excellent decision. The town offers limited activities but provides a peaceful atmosphere.

**Visit after 4 PM** when tour groups depart for a more pleasant experience.

**La Madriguera** - a small, charming hotel with spectacular lake views.

**Bandeja Paisa** - a local specialty dish combining many ingredients together.
