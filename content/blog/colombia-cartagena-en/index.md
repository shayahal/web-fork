## Colombia Trip: Cartagena

The moment the plane door opened, you feel it: humid. Really humid. So humid you can't see through the steam on your glasses.

Cartagena is a historic city with evidence of ancient American settlements. It served as a significant Spanish port during colonial times. But the most interesting thing: it was the only city the Spanish failed to recapture in 1811, despite an enormous siege.

### Where to Stay

**Casa Moraira** - A well-located hotel in the old city with good AC that actually works properly.

### What to Do

Walk the old city and its stone walls with ocean views. Explore beyond the tourist district and discover authentic local squares that few tourists find.

### Food and Cocktails

**Celele** - This was the most delicious restaurant we ate at in Colombia. Caribbean cooking with a twist, using local ingredients and fascinating, amazing flavors. It was a highlight of the entire trip.

**El Barón** - A famous cocktail bar with high expectations. The cocktails weren't strong enough for me.

**Alquímico** - Another bar that didn't quite live up to the hype it had built up.

Cartagena deserves a visit - between history, food and warm Caribbean breezes, there's a lot to see and experience here.
