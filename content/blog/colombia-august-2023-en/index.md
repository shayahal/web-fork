## Colombia Trip, August 2023

I find myself recounting this trip over and over again. A full month in Colombia, an experience that gave us the chance to explore different ecosystems across the country.

### Trip Overview

The journey included diverse experiences throughout Colombia - from Caribbean coastlines, through Pacific shores, northeastern desert regions, Andes mountains, beautiful coffee plantation valleys, and even Amazon territory. We traveled as a "rich backpacker" - with private accommodations and gourmet dining, using domestic flights, buses, and arranged transportation.
