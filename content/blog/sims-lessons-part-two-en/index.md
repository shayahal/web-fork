I believe you can learn a lot about a person, their aspirations and hidden desires, from how they played The Sims (I'll leave aside those who would put them in a pool and remove the ladder). 

For me, it was simple to the point of embarrassment. I created a single Sim with the ambitious personality trait, built them a house that was too big, and immediately sent them on their life's mission: to be the best at everything. 

So I reached level 10 in all the skills. I grew bizarre plants, caught lobsters, beat everyone at chess. 

When that got boring, I sent them on their second life mission: to reach the highest rank in everything. 

That meant working in every job The Sims offered and reach the highest rank in all of them. There wasn't a single clue about what actually happens there, so the only hints were what they wear and how they're taken to work in the morning - a soccer player who goes to work in a helicopter, a spy who flies in a helicopter, a politician who also flies in a helicopter... maybe it was less diverse than I thought. 

In many ways, this also describes me as an adult. The world is bursting with opportunities, problems that are fascinating to solve, people I'm dying to work with, articles to read, fields to excel in. 

Sometimes I wonder if this appetite is a blessing or a curse - every choice is a surrender of infinite other possibilities. But then I remind myself that I have at least 34 more years until retirement. I know it's weird, but that comforts me. There will be many more helicopters to fly to work in. 

This might explain why people like to consult with me about careers - after all, I've basically done them all, scientist and businesswoman and chef. Actually, except for criminal - that was too stressful for me. 

In the next post: about the time I stopped at a red light in GTA-5.
