Crazy reveal! All the secrets about how I started working out! 💪

Or: why it's actually not my fault that I forgot to use the task management extension we built.

So here's the story - a few weeks ago [Miki Segall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miki-segall/) and I built an extension that helps define one important task to complete each day. It was fun, so we sat down last weekend (this time there was no couscous) to do a retro and talk about what's next.

In the spirit of "one thing," let's start with what bothered me most: I simply forgot to use it. It's still not a habit.

This sent me thinking a lot about how I build habits. So despite (or because of) giants having written about this, I decided to share my two cents - in infographic form, of course.

For me, the challenge with a new habit is actually the negotiation. It's that moment when my brain, right when needed, starts bargaining with the decision I made. That's where many habits I tried to establish over the years failed.

But what did work for me? Building myself a mechanism that neutralizes the negotiation!

I only work out very early in the morning. There's no moment when I wonder "Should I work out today?" Instead, the alarm rings, I get organized, and by the time I've actually woken up and realized what's happening - I'm already in the workout.

An external signal appears, and muscle memory is activated - no time to think! Get up and do it! No negotiations! 🗯️

And now, the same self-deception technique - also for One Thing.
And the best part - we're in the chrome store 👏
