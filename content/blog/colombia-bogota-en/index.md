## Colombia Trip: Bogotá

### Part One: A Capital City That Turned Out Pleasant

Bogotá surprised me. I stayed at Masaya hostel in the city center and discovered there was much more to do here than I expected.

I'd recommend just one to two days in the city, but there are definitely some must-visit places:

### Must-See Places

**Calle Del Embudo** - A colorful square where young people gather to drink chicha, a traditional Colombian beverage with an interesting history.

**Botero Museum** - A museum featuring Fernando Botero's distinctive artwork alongside some impressive Renaissance masterpieces. The collection is excellent.

**Jaguar Coffee Bogota** - An exotic coffee shop offering specialty coffee from different regions. Sharp, interesting flavors.

**Museo del Oro** (Gold Museum) - Less impactful than I expected, but still worth a quick visit.

**La Perseverancia Distrital Marketplace** - An authentic local food market. I ate at Mamá Luz's stall there - an excellent choice.

### Food and Coffee

**Jaguar Coffee** - A real recommendation for anyone who loves good coffee.

**La Perseverancia Market** - For an authentic experience. Try one of the local specialty dishes.

Bogotá isn't the main attraction, but it has its own charm when you explore it properly.
