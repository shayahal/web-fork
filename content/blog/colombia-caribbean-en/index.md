## Colombia Trip: The Caribbean Part

### Part Three: On a Solitary Island

At a small boutique hotel called Puntanorte on Tintipán Island near Cartagena, something shifts during three nights. It's a family hotel that accommodates up to 20 guests, with scattered bungalows, cozy seating areas, and almost everything accessible within minutes.

### The Experience

Every day, a local fisherman arrives with fresh fish and crustaceans. You choose what to cook for dinner. The next night, we walk to the opposite shore of the island to see bioluminescent plankton - new light in the sea.

On the second night, a tropical storm hits. I get completely drenched walking to facilities in our open-air thatched bungalow. But that was part of the experience.

### The Verdict

3 amazing days. Goodbye Tintipán!
