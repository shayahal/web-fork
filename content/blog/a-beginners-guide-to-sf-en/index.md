At the beginning of 2026, I spent two great weeks for work in San Francisco. After the mess that was there during covid, I expected unpleasant vibes, but discovered instead a charming and cool city with quite a bit of character. So wanted to share the places I love the most.

[True Laurel](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=True+Laurel+San+Francisco): a perfect cocktail bar where they already greet me by name. Amazing weekend brunch and the cocktails are generally excellent.

[Vesuvio Cafe](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Vesuvio+Cafe+San+Francisco): fun and great bar, where I made new friends and instead of snacks - they serve homemade pies that the owner's wife made.

[Tupper & Reed](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Tupper+Reed+Berkeley): a surprisingly good cocktail bar in Berkeley. The mexican bartender incorporates unique ingredients from South America.

[Smuggler's Cove](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Smuggler's+Cove+San+Francisco): famous tiki bar. Be careful, there is more booze in the drinks than you expect.

Nice shops:

[Green Apple Books](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Green+Apple+Books+San+Francisco): a fantastic bookstore that also hosts great events.

[Aggregated Supply](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Aggregated+Supply+San+Francisco): a shop with incredible staff who talked me into buying pants I hope I'll actually have the courage to wear.

Food:

[Hon's Wun-Tun House](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Hon's+Wun-Tun+House+San+Francisco): there are quite a few excellent soup dumplings in the city, but these really stood out.

[Dumpling Home](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Dumpling+Home+San+Francisco): okay, these were also great.

[Tartine](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Tartine+San+Francisco): the most hyped bakery in the city, and rightfully so.

[New England Lobster Market & Eatery](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=New+England+Lobster+Market+Eatery+San+Francisco): an amazing place near the airport to eat crabs tacos!

General tips:

[Partiful](https://www.partiful.com): I found plenty of events in the city, including a relaxed weekend gathering at a workspace that's somewhere between a community center and WeWork.

[SF Museum of Modern Art](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=SF+Museum+of+Modern+Art+San+Francisco) was a great place to roam and gather some thoughts.

[Corner Maps](https://www.cornermaps.com): I discovered the app that I always wanted to develop myself. The recommendations were excellent and great UI (just a bit heavy)
