title: "About Me"
---

I've built this site because I:
**Was kind of jealous** of my friend's sites.  
**Needed a place** to store my [cocktail recipes](/cocktails).  
**Always wanted to write** and lied to myself that I would do it only if I had a place to store it.  

This is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and discoveries. From **[general meditations](/blog)** to **[cocktail recipes](/cocktails)** and **[travel stories](/travel)**, you'll find a mix of stuff.
