I'm [Shay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shay-yahal/). I've spent many years in cybersecurity and machine learning - across research, engineering, ML, data science, and leadership roles.

Now I'm exploring different areas of AI, especially at the intersection of security, control, defense, and observability.

I originally built this website to store my cocktail recipes. Now it's home to many of the random things I think about - tech, philosophy, mathematics, travel, and more. Enjoy!
